2D Game Engine made entirely in C. Employs popular physics, multimedia, and ECS libraries - Chipmunk2D, SDL2, and Flecs respectively.

* Run `make install` to build and install to local library directory (Linux only)
* Once installed, test files can be built by running `make test` in the `test\test\` directory
* Currently no real documentation - still WIP
